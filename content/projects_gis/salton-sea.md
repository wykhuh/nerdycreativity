I did two projects about the shrinking of the Salton Sea.

## Project 1

For my final project for Foothills College Remote Sensing class, I examined the shrinkage of the Salton Sea. I grabbed Landsat data from 1984 to 2024 at 5 year intervals using Google Earth Engine.

I was the only software developer in the class. Knowing how to code improved my analysis. I was able to use my software skills to write functions to download the Landsat data, classify the images into land and water, and calculate the area of the lake. Knowing how to code allowed me to grab 9 set of images by adding one line of code per year. If I had to write separate code for each year, I would have only examimed data from two years.

## Project 2

As part of the catography course at PCC, I updated the appearance of the Salton Sea maps. I exported the raster tiffs from Google Earth Engine, imported them into ArcGIS Pro, and created maps and charts.
