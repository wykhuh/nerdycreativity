## Problem Statement

I wanted to create a free, no-code way for people to generate a website using Google Sheets.

## Project Details

This project fetches the data from Google Sheets, and creates a website with a searchable, sortable table. The website is hosted for free on Github pages.

The Google Sheets used in this demo is connected to a Google Form. People fill out a Google Form. The response are saved in Google Sheets. The data is used to populate the website.

Since I wanted people with no coding experience to use this project, I built the site using plain JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. No build process needed.
