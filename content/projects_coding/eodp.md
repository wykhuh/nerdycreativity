## Project Details

Extending Ocean Drilling Pursuits (eODP) is a NSF-funded project to clean and standardize fifty years of lithology and microfossil data from ocean drilling cores so the data could be imported into Macrostrat and the Paleobiology Database (PBDB). I worked closely with the four project PIs to create a reproducible workflow to clean, normalize, and import 50 years of lithology and taxonomy data.

I worked on this project as software engineer at Whirl-i-Gig.
