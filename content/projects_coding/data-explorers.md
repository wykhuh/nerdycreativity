## Problem Statement

iNaturalist website allows people to do basic data exploration of iNaturalist data. However, project owners have limited ability to customize the UI. I wanted to create a website that allow project owners to add more information and data exploration tools for their projects.

## Project Details

This project was started as part of the Open Life Science mentorship program.

Data Explorer is a website that allows iNaturalist project organizers to import their iNaturalist data, upload education materials, and add pre-built interactive data exploration tools for their project. By giving citizen scientists the chance to explore the data that they help collect, I hope citizen scientists will be encouraged to form their own questions, look for answers to their own questions, and thereby create a more engaging experience for both participants and organizers.

Because this project had no funding, I built the site as a static site that can run for free on Github pages.
