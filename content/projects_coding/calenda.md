## Project Details

In November 2017 I attended a bioblitz for CALeDNA, a University of California community science program that monitors California’s biodiversity through environmental DNA (eDNA). While talking to the executive director of CALeDNA, I realized that I could use my coding skills to help the program. What started as a four-week project to create an online map that shows the location of collected eDNA samples, turned into a three year collaboration with the CALeDNA researchers to create an open-data portal that communicates biodiversity information to the public, students, and researchers. I learned various taxonomy concepts, datasets, and tools in order to connect CALeDNA data to National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomy, iNaturalist, and Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI).
