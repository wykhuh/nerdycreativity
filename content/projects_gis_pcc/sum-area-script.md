## Project Details

One of the assignments for GEOG 115 was to write a post about a ArcGIS Pro toolbox script that you think would be useful.

One GIS task that I didn't enjoy was copying records in the attribute table, pasting the records into Excel, and creating a pivot table to calculate the sum for the area. I didn't like using a separate application to do such a common task, so instead of just posting about the problem, I decided to build a script to solve the problem.

I spent a couple of days learning about using Python in ArcGIS Pro, ArcPy, and toolbox scripts. I created a ArcGIS Pro toolbox script to group features by one or more fields (Row fields), and then calculate the sum of the for another field (Sum fields).
