## Project Details

As part of the Pasadena City Collge cartography course, I updated the appearance of the Salton Sea maps that I had done for Foothill College. I exported the raster tiffs from Google Earth Engine, imported them into ArcGIS Pro, and created maps and charts.

The first map shows the boundaries of the Salton Sea in 1984 and 2024. The chart shows the rate of change in the area. The second map show the change from 1984 to 2004. The thrid map shows the change from 2004 to 2024.
