For the final project of the Pasadena City College GEOG 115 Environmental Analysis with GIS class, students had the choice of creating a ArcGIS Dashboard or creating a ArcGIS StoryMap. Two students including myself choose to do dashboards, 18 students choose to do StoryMaps.

GIS is a technical subject. People are dealing with creating maps and charts to analyze an visualize geospatial data. Yet only two people were interested in creating dashboards to display that data. The rest wanted to tell a story with prose, images, and videos.

If storytelling is the preferred method of communicating for these geography students, then why do so many people in academic science research community deemphasized and discouraged
science communication to the general public?
