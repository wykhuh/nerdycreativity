As part of Pasadena City College's [Geographic Information Systems and Technology certificate](https://pasadena.edu/academics/divisions/natural-sciences/areas-of-study/gis.php) program, I'm enrolled in CIS 012 Introduction to Programming
Using Python. This is the first time I've taken a programming class in college. Previously, I learned programming through reading books, watching videos, and doing projects.

Hardest part of the class is the professor lowers the grade on homework assignments if students uses code not covered in the class. I have to carefully review the lecture material so I don't accidentally use code that wasn't covered in the class. In other words, I have to do what the professor taught instead of doing what I know would work.
