I finished the Mt San Antonio College GEOG 10 Introduction to GIS class. It was the first time I've used ArcGIS Pro.

I have previous experience with spatial analysis using PostGIS and R with sf. While there are advantages of GUI based spatial analysis, I miss being able to document the each step of the analysis the way I can when using code. With GUI based workflow, I get the final result I want, but there isn't any documentation about how I got those results. With code, you write down each step, so there is documentation about how you got the results.
